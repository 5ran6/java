# LinkedList

```
- It's another data structure - so the aim is to be able to store items efficiently (insertion adn removal operations) O(1)

- Arrays have a huge disadvantage: there may be holes in the data structure and we have to shift a lot of items, This problema can be eliminated by linkedlists

- We have access to the first node of the linked list (head node) others items can be accessed starting with this node 

- Last node of the linked list is pointing to a NULL

- Every node stores the data itself and a reference the next node in the linked list data structure

- This is why linked lists need more memory than arrays

- It has an advantage - there can not be holes in the data structure so there is no need for shifting items

- Easy data structures and easy to implement them

- The items are not stored nexto to each other in the memory - so there is no random indexing

- We can implementing more complex data structures and abstract data types such as stacks and queues

- Huge disadvantage of linked list is that it is a slow operation to insert items at the end  O(N) running time

FINDING ARBITRARY ITEM IN THE LINKED LIST STILL HAS O(N) LINEAR RUNNING TIME
