# Data Structures Overview
```
Data Structures came to be in order to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases
and internet indexing service.

Modern applications and softwares are manipulating a huge amount of data (Facebook users, Instagram images, Twitter posts, etc.)

How to deal with this huge amounts of data?

Somewhow we have to make sure the application is as fast as possible and this is exactly why using the right data structures is crucial

Defines the concrete implementation or actual representation of the data

The aims is to be able to store and retrieve data in an efficient manner

What we want: to be able insert, find or remove items in O(1) running time complexity 
O(1) is the best case scenario we are after - the faster the better!!!

For example: Arrays, LinkedLists, Binary Trees

```

# Abstract Data Types
```
Basically abstract data types define the model (logical description) for a certain data structure

It's like a supertype in programming (so an interface or abstract class)

We just define what methods (functions) the data structure will have, so we define the basic behavior

IMPORTANT: It's just the model, abstract data type does not specify the concrete implementation or programming language

For example: when dealing with a stack abstract data type: push(), pop() and peek() methods (functions)
