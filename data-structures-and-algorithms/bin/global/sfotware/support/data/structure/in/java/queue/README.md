# Queues
```
- It is an abstract data type - and it can be implemented either with arrays or with linked lists

- It has a so called FIFO structure - the first item we inserted is the first item we take out

- Basic operations are enqueue(), dequeue() and peek()

- Has several applications in operating systems and thread management (multithreading)
```

## Queues Applications
```
- Queues are useful when a resource is shared with several consumers (for example threads)

- Threads are stored in queues

- Queues are important in CPU scheduling

- When data is transfered asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two process

- Graph algorithms rely heavily on queues: breadth-first search use queue as an underlying abastract data type
