#Recursion

```
Pros
- DRY
- Readability

Cons
- Large Stack

When to use Recursion?
In algorithms BFS + DFS (Searching)

Rule:
Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider RECURSION.
1 - Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2 - Each sentence of the subproblem is identical in nature.
3 - The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.

Divide and conquer using RECURSION.

Anything you do with a recursion CAN be done iteratively (loop)
